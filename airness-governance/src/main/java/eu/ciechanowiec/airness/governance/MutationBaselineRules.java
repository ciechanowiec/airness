/**
 * Compares the mutants a run left alive against the ones this repository has accepted, and reports the
 * two ways the two can disagree.
 *
 * <p>The accepted set is a list rather than a count. A count cannot tell one mutant from another, so
 * killing an accepted mutant while introducing a real one leaves the total unchanged and the gap
 * invisible. That window is narrow at a dozen entries and wide at a hundred. Listing them makes the
 * two failures distinct: a survivor nobody accepted is a new gap, and an accepted entry that no longer
 * survives is a stale line to delete, which is what stops the list from rotting into a blanket
 * exemption.
