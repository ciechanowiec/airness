/**
 * Reads the natural-language prose of a Java comment and reports the two punctuation marks this
 * repository does not spell that way.
 *
 * <p>The first is the semicolon. It joins two clauses that could each stand alone, so it always has a
 * shorter reading: a full stop, which lets each clause be read on its own, or a comma when the second
 * clause is genuinely subordinate. Comments are read under time pressure and out of order, and the
 * shorter reading is the one that survives that.
 *
 * <p>The second is the full stop inside a {@code @return} tag. That tag completes the sentence "returns
 * ...", so it is a fragment and takes no full stop, which is also why the semicolon ban does not reach
 * inside it: with no full stop available, a semicolon is the right way to hang a second clause off a
 * fragment. The two rules are a pair, and splitting a {@code @return} into sentences to satisfy the
 * first is what made them one.
 *
 * <p>Every comment form is read, in every tracked Java source, because a reader of a comment does not
 * care which syntax carried it. A {@code Justification} value is read alongside them, because it is a
 * comment that happens to be written as an annotation: the same sentence, addressed to the same reader,
 * and exempting it would let a suppression's reason say what a comment beside it may not. Literals are
 * tokenized out first rather than stripped by a lone comment
 * pattern, so a {@code "https://example.test";} cannot be mistaken for a line comment ending in a
 * semicolon. Four regions inside a comment are skipped, because punctuation in them is syntax: a
 * {@code <pre>} sample and an inline {@code @code} or {@code @literal} tag are code, an inline
 * {@code @link} may qualify a name, and an HTML entity ends in a semicolon by construction, that being
 * how an entity is written. The scan takes decoded text and never touches the filesystem, so it stays a
 * pure, unit-testable rule.
 *
 * <p>The em dash and en dash are not this rule's concern even though they raise the same question of
 * how a sentence is joined. They are banned outright, in every tracked file and every commit message,
 * by {@link TypographyRules}, so repeating them here would give one guideline two owners that could
 * later disagree.
