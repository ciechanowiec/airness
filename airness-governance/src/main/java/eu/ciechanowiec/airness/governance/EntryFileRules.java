 * have one home whichever tool reads them.
 *
 * <p>A line states something beyond the reference when removing the instruction file's name from it
 * leaves a letter or a digit behind. That reading accepts the forms a reference actually takes, an
 * import marker or a bare path, and rejects prose, because prose cannot be written without letters.
 * The alternative, asking whether a line merely mentions the name, would pass a line that names the
 * instruction file and then goes on to state a rule.
