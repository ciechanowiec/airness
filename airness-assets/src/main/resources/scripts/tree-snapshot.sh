# snapshot (bound to validate) records a content fingerprint of every tracked file plus every untracked
# file that is not ignored; verify (bound to package) takes the same fingerprint again and compares, so
# work you had already edited sits in the first fingerprint and cannot fail the build. Ignored paths,
# target/ above all, are excluded.
#
# What it reports is a change made between those two points, by anything at all: it cannot tell the build
# apart from an editor saving a file while the build runs, and a file written that way is blamed on the
# build. That is the price of knowing nothing about who wrote to the tree, and it is the right trade for
# a net whose whole job is to catch writers nobody anticipated.
#
# This is the tool-agnostic net behind the check-only goals of OpenRewrite, the formatter and the import
# sorter: it knows nothing about who wrote to the tree, so it also covers a script that strands a
# temporary file and any future plugin that edits sources without being asked. The pom explains the rule
# the two halves serve; a build that means to reshape sources runs with -Pformat, which applies before this compares.
